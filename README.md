# Procedural Snowflakes

Procedural Snowflakes is a snowflake generator that creates unique snowflakes based on the paper:

> A local cellular model for snow crystal growth,
> Clifford A. Reiter, Department of Mathematics, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042, USA

The paper can be found [here](paper/SnowCrystalGrowth.pdf).

The program let's you generate your own unique snowflake that reflects your personality.

## Getting started

Make sure you have **Go 1.17** or greater installed. If not you can download the [installer here](https://golang.org/dl/) or use brew:

```
brew install go
```

Once **Go** is installed you need to install all dependencies. Go to the projects root directory and run:

```
go get snow
```

Now we are all set! You start the program by calling `go run . <parameters>` from the root directory. For the program to execute properly it expects 6 parameters to be passed as arguments, in this order:

- **A**: Alpha constant (around 1.0). If A is above 1.0 a small amount of water is added to the environment every itteration and if it's below 1.0 a small amount is evaporating from the environment. Think of it as the environments humidity.
- **B**: Background level (between 0.0 and 1.0). The initial base water level in the environment.
- **Y**: Growth constant (between 0.0 and 1.0). How cold the evironment is. To colder it is the faster the neighbours to a frozen hexagon freezes.
- **PP**: Perlin noise period (0.0 or more). The initial water level noise period.
- **PM**: Perlin noise magnitude (0.0 or more). The initial water level noise magnitude.
- **L**: Loops (0.0 or more). Amount of simulation loops.

Best practice is to start somewhere and tweak the numbers until it generates a snowflake you like. A good place to start is:

```
go run . 1 0.33 0.0002 0.05 0.2 10000
```

Generated snowflakes are saved as **PNG** in the **snowflakes/** folder. They are given the name of their properties they were created with.

Heavy simulations need lots of CPU power. If your computer is burning up you can either reduce the amount of loops (**L**) or change the matrix size to a lower number in `snow.go`. The row you want to change looks like this:

```
// matrix size, this decides the size of the image
const size int = 800
```
